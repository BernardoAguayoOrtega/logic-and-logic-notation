                <p>
                    Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic which studies the logical relationships between <strong>propositions</strong>(or statements, sentences, assertions) taken as a whole, and connected via logical <strong>connectives</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Propositional logic is also know by the names <strong>sentential logic, propositional calculus & sentencial calculus</strong>
                </p>

                    In propositional logic a statement (or proposition) is represented by a symbol(or letter) whose relationship with other statements is defined via a set of symbols (or connectives). The statement is described by it's <strong>truth value</strong>                    which is either <strong>true </strong> or <strong>false</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unlike syllogistic logic, in proposition logic, this statement is taken in its entirety, usually represented by a symbol, and we only cocern orlselves with whether or no it is true or false.

                <p>
                    In a propositional logic, a <strong>proposition</strong> by convention is represented by a capital letter, typically boldface. For example, the proposition above might be represented by the letter <strong>A</strong>
                </p>
                <code>
                    <strong>A:</strong>All elephants are green

                    Truth Value
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Each of the <strong>propositions</strong> is assigned a <strong>truth value</strong> of either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. In other areas (for example computer logic gates) these values are given by the binary
                    representations 1 (true) and 0(false)
                </p>

                <p>
                    In propositional logic, the relationships between propositions are represented by <strong>connectives.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are essentially five different <strong>connectives</strong>

                    Suppose we wanted to say "If it rains, Jake won't walk to school" <br> We would first represent the two propositions as a proposition

                    A: It rains <br> B: Jake won't walk to school <br> Then we would use the conditional connective to make our statement. <br> A → B

                <p>
                    In order to clarafy the meaning of a proposition or a connective, a <strong>truth table</strong> is used.

                <p>
                    True tables are a way of visualizing the truth values of propositions. A value of <strong>true</strong> is represented by a <strong>"1"</strong> and a value of <strong>false</strong> is represnted by a <strong>"0"</strong>

                <small>Example</small>
                <p>
                    Consider the following propositions

                    <li>
                        If Juan doesn't wear green boots but has a dog, then proposition <strong>C</strong> is <strong>false</strong>.

                    Suppose we have the following statement (compound proposition): <br> If Rebecca finishes her homework, then she can watch Netflix. <br> Is this a logical conditional? <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This consists of the two simple propositions that we will call P and Q: <br> P: Rebecca finishes her homework. <br> Q: Rebecca watches Netflix. <br> Then, we can set up the following conditional statement, using a conditional connective:
                    <br> P → Q <br>
                </p>

                    Biconditional
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A biconditional is a connective that represents the condition "if and only if". <br> It checks for whether both of the propositions evaluate to the same truth value. It can also be thought of as (A→B)∧(B→A). <br>

                <p>
                    What type of logic proposition is this?: <br> We will cancel the parade if and only if it rains. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is equivalent to saying. "If it rains we will cancel the parade, and if we cancel the parade then it's raining." Note: This doesn't imply causation. That is, it doesn't imply that because we cancelled the parade it is raining. In fact it just means
                    that if it isn't raining, we will definitely hold the parade.
                    <br>
                    <br> We set up the following propositions:
                    <br>
                    <br> P: We will cancel the parade.
                    <br> Q: It rains.
                    <br> Then we write our compound proposition as:
                    <br> P↔Q
